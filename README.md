## Tensorbleu

Tensorbleu is a project with the aim to write deep learning and machine learning algorithms and techniques in C++. This is meant to understand some of the things that we take for granted while prototyping in Python. We hope that while implementing this project we understand the kind of design decisions that need to be taken inorder to develop a good deep learning based library.
